# Link to deploy version of Application 

# Introduction
The result of this collaboration project is building a recipe application using React and Nex.js. In this application the Mongo DB database has been used. To managing and integrating the project GitHub been used. In this web-based application the user can:
In the website the user able to :
1. Search for all Recipes
1. Login 
1. registration 
1. Logout  
1. Adding new Recipes
1. Adding comments under each recipe 
1. Like each recipe

# Project Management 
At the first step the template of UI created. We decided to separate the project to 3 parts.
1. The home page and Search for all recipes: Nastaran 
1. Registration and login/logout: Toni 
1. adding new Recipes and adding comments and like: Michal

We used projects part of GitHub to assign each task to each person in the group. We also, created a group in teams to share all images and any meetings.

Also, we created a WhatsApp group to ask our urgent questions there and communication. With having weekly development meetings, we improved the communication between us in the group.

The most important part of developing a project is version control. We used GitHub to monitor all changes and finding any problem after merging our code. As soon as we had any problem, we made a NEW ISSUE in the GitHub and assign it to ourselves. Then the owner of the issue makes a commit and push that to the new branch that already has been made. Then, the owner of issue makes pull request for staging and then will  be merged by the owner of the issue. We decided the only person who can push and merge into the main is the leader just to prevent any error in the code.

The next step was deciding about the environment of our source code editor and the technologies we are going to use. We decided to use vocode as it was easier to add any extension or package installing for out project. 

We also, used many tools in our project for managing static code analysis. One of the decisions that has been made in this project is using Type Script as it is helpful for prevent common errors in our application.

Then for making the code more consistent and avoiding bugs we installed ESlint and prettier. With Eslint we made a few rules to finding the common errors. We used prettier to make sure our code consistent between all files, then we can understand our each other codes and make it easier for others too to understand our code. 
For automated acceptance/integration tests we used Cypress. This tool helped us to test that how a user can interact with our application.

The approach that we used in this project is component base. Storybook is an environment that allows us to create and showcase components outside of our main application. Storybook helped us to documenting our project and, made reusing the components easier.

# Reflection And Future Work
The result of this project was building a web-based Recipe application, but the main goal of this project was collaboration in a teamwork project and keep the code consistency and error free. We believe we almost got the goal although we finished the project about 2 weeks late due an issue. 
We worked effectively together. Whenever one of us had a problem to finishing a task or had an error for something, other team member helped the person to solve the problem as it was a group work, and we were working to get the same goal. 
We learned how to manage the time and how to break tasks into a smaller section and divide it between the team members. At the beginning the project seems to be easy but we immediately realised that the project is more complex than we thought. So, we learned to think about the project deeply before  we make any plan. 

We couldn't make some features for the application that we had plan for that and they are:
1. Adding admin page 
1. Adding session variable for login system 
1. Adding Basket and wallet for the user

Also, for feature work it is recommended to add recommendation system using machine learning algorithm for the project.
